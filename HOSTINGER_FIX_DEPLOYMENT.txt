    FIX: HOSTINGER "UNSUPPORTED FRAMEWORK" ERROR
================================================================================

✅ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

THE ISSUE:
==========
Hostinger's automated deployment expects:
- package.json in the ROOT directory
- Specific folder structure
- Files extracted, not as tar.gz

THE SOLUTION:
=============
We need to create a Hostinger-compatible structure OR upload files manually.

================================================================================

SOLUTION 1: MANUAL FILE UPLOAD (RECOMMENDED)
============================================

Hostinger doesn't process tar.gz files automatically. You need to:

STEP 1: Extract the Archive Locally
-----------------------------------
On your computer:
1. Double-click pos-system-deploy.tar.gz
2. OR extract with: tar -xzf pos-system-deploy.tar.gz
3. This creates a folder with: backend/, frontend-build/, etc.

STEP 2: Upload Files via FTP or File Manager
--------------------------------------------
Upload the EXTRACTED files (not the tar.gz):

METHOD A: Via File Manager (hPanel)
1. Log into Hostinger hPanel
2. Go to File Manager
3. Navigate to your domain folder (public_html or www)
4. Upload the EXTRACTED folders:
   - backend/
   - frontend-build/
   - DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.txt

METHOD B: Via FTP
1. Use FileZilla
2. Connect to Hostinger FTP
3. Upload the EXTRACTED folders directly
4. Don't upload the tar.gz file

================================================================================

SOLUTION 2: HOSTINGER NODE.JS APP STRUCTURE
============================================

If using Hostinger's Node.js App feature:

STEP 1: Create Correct Structure
---------------------------------
Hostinger expects:
- package.json in ROOT
- server.js in ROOT (or specified path)
- All files in one folder

STEP 2: Create Hostinger-Compatible Package
--------------------------------------------
Run the new script I'll create: HOSTINGER_DEPLOY.sh

This creates a structure Hostinger can recognize.

================================================================================

SOLUTION 3: UPLOAD VIA FTP (BEST METHOD)
=========================================

STEP 1: Extract Archive on Your Computer
-----------------------------------------
1. Extract pos-system-deploy.tar.gz
2. You'll get folders: backend/, frontend-build/

STEP 2: Connect via FTP
-----------------------
1. Get FTP credentials from Hostinger hPanel
2. Use FileZilla (free FTP client)
3. Connect to your server

STEP 3: Upload Folders
----------------------
1. Navigate to your domain folder on server
2. Upload backend/ folder
3. Upload frontend-build/ folder (rename to build/)
4. Upload all files

STEP 4: Configure on Server
---------------------------
1. SSH to server (if VPS) or use Terminal in hPanel
2. Navigate to uploaded folder
3. Install dependencies: cd backend && npm install
4. Start application

================================================================================

WHY THE ERROR OCCURS:
=====================

Hostinger's automated deployment:
- Expects package.json in root
- Expects specific structure
- Doesn't process tar.gz archives
- Needs files already extracted

Our package structure:
- Has backend/ and frontend-build/ as separate folders
- package.json is in backend/
- This doesn't match Hostinger's expected structure

================================================================================

QUICK FIX - DO THIS NOW:
========================

OPTION A: Extract and Upload Manually
--------------------------------------
1. Extract pos-system-deploy.tar.gz on your computer
2. Upload the extracted folders via FTP or File Manager
3. Don't use Hostinger's automated deployment

OPTION B: Use New Hostinger Script
-----------------------------------
I'll create a script that makes Hostinger-compatible structure.
Run it and upload the new package.
