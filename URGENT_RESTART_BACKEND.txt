    URGENT: RESTART BACKEND SERVER - OUTLETS 404 ERROR
================================================================================

🔴 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The backend server is running but was started BEFORE the outlets route was added.
The route file exists and is correct, but the running server doesn't have it loaded.

✅ SOLUTION: RESTART THE BACKEND SERVER NOW
================================================================================

STEP 1: Find and Stop Backend Process
--------------------------------------
The backend is running on process ID: 88318

Option A - Kill by process ID:
  kill 88318

Option B - Kill by port:
  lsof -ti:5001 | xargs kill

Option C - Find and kill manually:
  1. Open Activity Monitor (Mac) or Task Manager
  2. Find "node" process running server.js
  3. Force quit it

STEP 2: Restart Backend Server
-------------------------------
Run these commands:

  cd "/Users/endiroswendi/Documents/ Old Laptop Documents/CAO/FINANCIAL REPORT/pos-inventory-system/backend"
  npm start

STEP 3: Verify Route is Loaded
--------------------------------
Look for these messages in console:
  ✓ Outlets route imported successfully
  ✓ Outlets route registered at /api/outlets
  📋 Registered API routes:
    - /api/outlets ✓

STEP 4: Test the Endpoint
--------------------------
Open browser and test:
  http://localhost:5001/api/outlets

Should return: [] (empty array)

STEP 5: Test in Frontend
-------------------------
1. Refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Go to Outlets page
3. Should work now!

================================================================================
QUICK COMMANDS:
================================================================================

# Stop backend (choose one):
kill 88318
# OR
lsof -ti:5001 | xargs kill

# Restart backend:
cd "/Users/endiroswendi/Documents/ Old Laptop Documents/CAO/FINANCIAL REPORT/pos-inventory-system/backend"
npm start

================================================================================
WHY THIS HAPPENED:
================================================================================

The outlets route was added AFTER the backend server was started.
Node.js loads routes when the server starts, so new routes require a restart.

The route is correctly configured:
✓ Route file exists: backend/routes/outlets.js
✓ Route is exported: module.exports = router;
✓ Route is imported: const outletsRoutes = require('./routes/outlets');
✓ Route is registered: app.use('/api/outlets', outletsRoutes);

Everything is correct - just needs server restart!
